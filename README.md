# Wizard of Wor Disassembly (coin-op arcade game)

This disassembly was started by myself a LONG time ago. There is much to write in this README file but it will have to wait as I have other obligations at the moment.
It is a very rudimentry disassembly and the last update was about 2018. There is a comment that the code is "Verified working" but I haven't tested it so your milage may vary.
I hope to get back to working on this code but if anyone would like to contribute, create a branch and go for it. :-)

This README.md file will be updated with more details later.
